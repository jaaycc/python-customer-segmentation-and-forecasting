# python-customer-segmentation-and-forecasting

In this project, I've worked with a dataset containing 25.9k unique transactions from a UK-based online retail store. The main goal here is to explore the data thoroughly, find interesting insights, and use them to improve business decisions. To do this, I've used various techniques, including data manipulation, exploring the data's patterns, customer segmentation, and forecasting future sales using various Machine Learning models.
